# Bio
I recently finished an MS in Epidemiology @ the University of Washington. My research centered on topics including healthcare access, mental health, health impacts of immigration, spatial epidemiology, and substance use in WA State. My interests in population health broadly are centered on the political-economy of health, social and structural factors that impact health and illness, and interventions that can alleviate health disparities. I'm currently on paternity leave and seeking out PhD opportunities.
