# Hey there!
 
I'm Aaron J.R. Ferguson, a social epidemiologist passionate about interdisciplinary approaches to population health, drawing on my background in cultural anthropology and history. I'm passionate about social impact and believe we need to broadly reimagine health in our society. This demands critical perspectives on science, society, and population health, integrating intercultural and historical perspectives on health & medicine. 

## What I'm up to
* ✒️ Writing at Tabula, a publication exploring fresh perspectives on questions animating some of the most pivotal matters in health, history and culture
* 🎓 Recently finished an MS in Epidemiology at University of Washington where I researched the impact of Medicaid expansion on healthcare coverage and mental health burden among low-income young adults without US citizenship.
* 🔎 On the Board of Directors of Near Vision Institute, a non-profit re-envisioning rural and school-based pediatric optometry and providing innovative mobile vision therapy to children in WA state
* ⭐️ Manager of Community Programs @ FastMesh WiFi where I created and oversee a highly successful internet affordability program offering free high-speed broadband WiFi to underserved low-income households in Seattle and Portland  
* 👶 Currently on parental leave for the birth of my first child :)
